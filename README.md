## 🎯 What Is CareBridge?

A **donation platform** connecting patients in need, verified hospitals, and donors worldwide.

**How it works:**

1. Hospital treats patient for **free** 🆓
2. Hospital uploads bill (medicine names + cost + hospital stamp) — **no patient photos or names**
3. Donation request goes public 🌐
4. Donor pays hospital directly 💲
5. Patient gets healthy ✅

**No money? No problem. No privacy violation? Guaranteed.**
